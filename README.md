# ü§ü Znakovito üåç

Znakovito is a groundbreaking web application born out of the Fon Hakaton competition in Serbia, where the challenge was to devise a software solution to bridge the language barrier. Our team has crafted a unique solution to empower users to overcome linguistic obstacles by providing a platform that facilitates communication through sign language.

## Key Features:
- **Universal Translation**: Znakovito allows users to input text in any language and converts it into sign language, making communication accessible to diverse linguistic communities.
- **Speech-to-Sign**: With its innovative speech-to-sign feature, Znakovito enables users to communicate verbally with sign language speakers, fostering seamless interaction and understanding.
- **Language Learning**: Beyond breaking communication barriers, Znakovito serves as a valuable tool for language learning, offering users an immersive experience in both written and sign languages.
- **Inclusive Support**: Designed with inclusivity in mind, Znakovito aims to bridge the gap between deaf individuals and the hearing community, fostering understanding and connection.
- **Multilingual Support**: Znakovito stands out as the world's only software solution supporting Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian languages, catering to the linguistic needs of the region like no other platform.

## How It Works:
1. **Input Text**: Users can type or paste text in any language into the Znakovito interface.
2. **Translation**: Znakovito processes the text and translates it into sign language gestures.
3. **Communication**: The translated sign language is displayed, enabling effective communication with sign language speakers.
4. **Learning**: Users can also use Znakovito as a learning tool to familiarize themselves with sign language or new spoken languages.

## Mission:
Znakovito's mission is to democratize communication by eliminating language barriers and promoting inclusivity. We believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to express themselves freely, regardless of linguistic or hearing differences.
